## Abstract

Hi Walter, marieke writing here. I added one notebook file to your folder. In this you can find the scripts i have used in blender.
Aso, there is a zip file. Since the add on for gaussian splats (https://github.com/ReshotAI/gaussian-splatting-blender-addon) did not import the cluster name for the gaussian splats when importing a gaussian splat, I changed the code so it was possible to see the cluster per gaussian splat.
Because before, the whole column was not visible in blender so showing the cluters was not possible.

Also make sure how to tell how to upload an IFC model into blender.

And how to visualise clusters individually in blender for a gaussian splatted file. Make sure to import the add on I have added to this folder.
