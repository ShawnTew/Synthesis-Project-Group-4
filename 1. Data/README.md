# Data management
<!-- Qiaorui Yang, Shawn Tew, Xiaduo Zhao, Walter Kahn, Marieke van Arnhem -->

## Abstract
Data is an important part of this process and storing and keeping track of created data will save a lot of time as such we give a possible implementation of the data structure. The folder structure as we recommend and used during the project is as follows:

- GeoSLAM
  - ply file
  - Images folder
    - CubeMAP Images
    - Panoramic Images
- IFC
- Phone Images
