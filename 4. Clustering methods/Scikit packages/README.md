## Abstract
In this folder two notebook files are located. One for segmenting gaussian splats and one for a point cloud. They are clustered based on their attributes (which differ). The notebook gives insights into the process.


## Steps
1. Set up an environment that has [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/install/index.html), [plyfile](https://python-plyfile.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/install.html), [numpy](https://numpy.org/install/), [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html#install-official-release) and [seaborn](https://pypi.org/project/seaborn/) installed.
2. If you want to cluster a gaussian splatted file, go to the notebook *clustering gaussian splat files.ipynb*. The notebook contains multiple *TO DO* 's, make sure to read them and follow them.
   - The notebook will create a clustered file based on the model implemented there. The result will be showed in this folder: *7. Results/Segmented Gaussian splats/*.
3. If you want to cluster a point cloud file, go to the notebook *clustering point cloud files.ipynb*. The notebook contains multiple *TO DO* 's, make sure to read them and follow them.
   - The notebook will create a clustered file based on the model implemented there. The result will be showed in this folder: *7. Results/Segmented Point Cloud/*.
