### Integrating Gaussian Splatting with Semantic Labels for Heritage BIM

In recent years, the need for heritage preservation and reconstruction has become evi
dent as many mature buildings face the risk of deterioration, damage or loss due to fac
tors such as urban development, environmental weathering as well as outdated infras
tructure. This urgency has created surges of significant interest to find sustainable meth
ods of heritage preservation. The rise of emerging digital technologies has introduced
 a multitude of innovative methods for storing, analysing, and showcasing building data.
 Technologies such as 3D LiDAR scanning, and Building Information Modelling enable de
tailed documentation and virtual exploration of heritage sites, while digital databases and
 archives facilitate the easy access and use of historical records. This project will attempt
 to address a new method of heritage preservation by using Gaussian Splatting in con
junction with segmentation methods to create a visually accurate model while also incor
porating semantic labels.
